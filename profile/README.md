## Welcome to the Creton Lab!

Our research focuses on brain development and behavior, using zebrafish and mice as model systems. We have high-throughput implementations available for the analysis of behavior in our model systems:

🐟 Zebrafish larvae ([384 well set-up](https://github.com/brown-ccv/Automated-Analysis-of-Zebrafish))

🐁 Mice ([8 cage set-up](https://github.com/Creton-Lab/Home-Cage-Analysis-of-Mouse-Behavior))

> ***Coming soon***  
> 🐟 Zebrafish adults
